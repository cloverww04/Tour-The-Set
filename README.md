# Project Name
Tour-The-Set

# Overview

This web application was built as part of a school project for Nashville Software School to demonstrate basic CRUD while getting familiar with external API's. It allows a user to search for a movie then view the details of that movie, and if they would like, they can click on the film locations and it displays them using a Google Maps API. The user can also add movies to their favorites list for viewing later if they would like.

# Features
- Users can create their own movies and store them with firebase
- Read/view the movie information using RapidApi's movie data base which retrieves the information about a movie.
- Update/edit the movie information
- Delete movies from a favorites list
- Display film locations using Google Maps API
